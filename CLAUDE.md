# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LeafKnow appears to be a new project in an empty directory. This is likely a knowledge management or learning platform based on the project name.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the development setup will depend on what technology stack is chosen. Common next steps might include:

- Initializing a git repository: `git init`
- Setting up a package.json for Node.js projects: `npm init`
- Creating initial project structure based on chosen framework

## Architecture

The project architecture will be determined as development begins. Consider the following when making architectural decisions:

- Whether this will be a web application, mobile app, or desktop application
- Frontend framework choice (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Backend requirements (API, database, authentication)
- Deployment strategy

## Common Commands

Commands will be added as the project develops and build tools are configured.

## Notes

- This is currently an empty project directory
- Technology stack and architecture decisions need to be made
- Consider checking with the project owner about requirements and preferences before proceeding with major implementation decisions
